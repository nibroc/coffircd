coffircd
========

`coffircd` is an IRC daemon written in CoffeeScript intended to run on NodeJS. In its current state, it is a toy project intended for teaching me CoffeeScript and reacquainting me with NodeJS.

Configuration
=============

To get the server running, no configuration should be required, but for tweaking purposes, see `coffircd.json`.

Execution
=========

Make sure required modules are installed (`npm install`), and then run the server with the `coffee` command `coffee coffircd.coffee`.
